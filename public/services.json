It’s a popular street food that is traditionally made in the form of spiced meats that are stacked on a vertical rotisserie with thin slices shaved off as it rotates. But don’t worry! We can cook our horizontally in a good old pan or on the BBQ!Shawarma was traditionally made with lamb, mutton and chicken though these days you see it with beef too. It’s commonly served in the form of a wrap, though in some countries you see it served on plates with sides such as seasoned rice or fries, and salads. In this recipe, I’m giving you both options!",

        "description": "If you love making a cappuccino, you might also enjoy a macchiato (our personal favorite). A Macchiato is 2 shots espresso with a thick layer of foam on top. It has no steamed milk mixed into the drink! You make the steamed or frothed milk in the same way as a cappuccino. The difference is, you spoon all that “dry foam” off the top of the milk and dollop it into the espresso. It’s like a lighter cappuccino without the extra calories. You can also try an Iced Cappuccino! Combine espresso and a splash of milk with ice, then top with a layer of fluffy cold foam. It’s a deliciously refreshing spin on the classic.",
